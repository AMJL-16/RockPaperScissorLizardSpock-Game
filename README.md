# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a variation of Rock Paper Scissors made popular by the television show The Big Bang Theory.

## Bugs or warnings 

when passing the js code through the jshint validator few warnings appeared saying that const is only available in 'esversion 6'

so i did some research and found that i could write /* jshint esversion : 6 */ to fix that .
I found the solution here :   https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/
